# SNAPaint
SNAPaint is a basic 2D raster graphics editor built with the Snap! programming language.

It's nothing more than a roughly one-month project for a freshman computer science class. **DO NOT, I REPEAT, *DO NOT* RELY ON IT.** I have no idea in how many ways this thing could break. The canvas size is limited to a 2005-era resolution anyway. And the execution speed is positively horrific. Just don't. *Just don't.*

###### I can still see you. Don't. Please.
